# Utilities Directory

This directory contains helper functions and utility classes used throughout the application.

## Contents

- Common helper functions
- Shared utility classes
- Reusable decorators
- Generic type definitions

## Usage Guidelines

1. Keep functions pure and stateless when possible
2. Document all public functions with type hints
3. Include unit tests for all utilities
4. Avoid business logic - this should be in the services directory
